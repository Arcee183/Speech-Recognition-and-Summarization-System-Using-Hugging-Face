# Speech-Recognition-and-Summarization-System-Using-Hugging-Face

This project teaches you how to build your own transcription and summarization system for any audio file with speech. The project makes use of the vosk language transciption models and the hugging face summarization transformers. To succesfully replicate the project, you will need to download the following libraries:

- vosk
- pydub
- torch
- transformers

To be able to gain access to the large language vosk model and punctuation models, having a system with at least 16 GB of RAM is recommended. This project can be run using CPU, no GPU processing needed. 

This project could be improved by playing around with the segmentation of the audio file and the splitting of the tokens for the summarization function.
